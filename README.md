[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/faramozzayw/learn-rust)](https://repl.it/github/faramozzayw/learn-rust)

In this repository, I save my experiments with the Rust programming language.
At the moment, I have no way to add a .gitignore file([why?](https://repl.it/talk/ask/gitignore-alternative/22235)), there are several files in the repository that cargo generates.

You can try to run the code from this repo [on the site here](https://play.rust-lang.org/).
